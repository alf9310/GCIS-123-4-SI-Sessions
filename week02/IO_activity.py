#We're going to practice reading input, storing it, and printing it
#Prompt the user to read everyone's name for as many people there are
#Store the names in seperate variables

#What type are these variables stored as? Which characters can this type hold?

#What are the two ways to run this program?

#Print the names to terminal, along with the description: "Names:"

#How do you print " " or ' '?

#Time to push to git!
