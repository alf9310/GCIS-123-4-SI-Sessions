#We're going to practice reading input, storing it, and printing it
#Prompt the user to read everyone's name for as many people there are
#Store  names in a variable
name = input("What is your name? ")

#What type are these variables stored as? Which characters can this type hold? Strings, all! (except ' and ")

#What are the two ways to run this program? Command line python, VSC "Run"

#Print the names to terminal, along with the description: "Name:"
print("Name: " + "\"" + name + "\"")
#How do you print " " or ' '? backslash beforehand \ "escape character"

#Time to push to git!
